            <h3>Car Financing Options</h3>
<p>When it comes to financing a car, you have several options, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Understanding these can help you make an informed decision.</p>

<article>
    <h4>Bank Loans</h4>
    <p>Bank loans are a popular option for financing a car. They often offer competitive interest rates and flexible repayment terms. However, they usually require a good credit score.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A 5-year loan with an interest rate of 4% could save you money in the long run compared to dealership financing.</p>

    <h4>Credit Union Loans</h4>
    <p>Credit unions are member-owned financial institutions that often offer more favorable loan terms compared to banks. They may provide lower interest rates and more flexible repayment options.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Some credit unions offer rates as low as 2.5% for new car loans.</p>

<article>
    <h4>Dealership Financing</h4>
    <p>Dealership financing is an option that allows you to obtain a loan directly from the car dealer. This is convenient but can sometimes result in higher interest rates.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Dealerships may offer "0% financing" deals, but these often require a perfect credit score and may come with other hidden costs.</p>
